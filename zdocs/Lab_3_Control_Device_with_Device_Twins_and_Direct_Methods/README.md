## What you will learn

You will learn how to control an [Azure Sphere](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-sphere/?WT.mc_id=github-blog-dglover) application using [Azure IoT Central](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/iot-central/?WT.mc_id=github-blog-dglover) Properties ([Azure IoT Hub Device Twins](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-device-twins?WT.mc_id=github-blog-dglover)) and Commands ([Azure IoT Hub Direct Methods](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-direct-methods?WT.mc_id=github-blog-dglover)).

---

## Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have completed [Lab 2: Send Telemetry from an Azure Sphere to Azure IoT Central](../Lab_2_Send_Telemetry_to_Azure_IoT_Central/README.md). You will have created an Azure IoT Central application, connected Azure IoT Central to your Azure Sphere Tenant and you have configured the **app_manifest.json** for the Azure Device Provisioning Service.

You will need to **copy** and **paste** the Lab 2 **app_manifest.json** you created to this lab's **app_manifest.json** file.

## Tutorial Overview

---

## Key Concepts

In Lab 1, **Peripherals** and **Timers** were introduced to simplify and effectively describe GPIO pins and Timers and their interactions.

In this lab, **DeviceTwinBindings**, and **DirectMethodBindings** are introduced to simplify the implementation of Azure IoT [Device Twins](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-device-twins?WT.mc_id=github-blog-dglover) and Azure IoT [Direct Methods](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-direct-methods?WT.mc_id=github-blog-dglover) on the device.

Both Device Twins and Direct Methods provide a mechanism to invoke functionality on a device from a custom Azure IoT Hub application or from an Azure IoT Central Application. For example, you may want to turn on a light, start a fan, or change the rate a sensor is sampled.

### Azure IoT Device Twins

When you set a Device Twin property in Azure IoT you are setting the *desired* state of a property on the device. Azure IoT will send a desired state message to the device, the device then actions the request, for example, turn on a LED, and the device will then send a *reported* state msg back to Azure IoT. Azure IoT then stores the *reported* state in the Azure IoT.

Azure IoT Central uses this *reported* state to display the last synced state of a property.

For more information refer to the [Understand and use device twins in IoT Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-device-twins?WT.mc_id=github-blog-dglover) article.

### Azure IoT Direct Methods

Azure IoT Direct Methods are simpler. When you invoke a *Direct Method* from Azure, a message is sent to the device. This message includes the name of the direct method and a data payload. The device will action the request and then respond with an HTTP status code to indicate success or failure along with an optional message.

For more information refer to the [Understand and invoke direct methods from IoT Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-direct-methods?WT.mc_id=github-blog-dglover) article.

## Device Twin Bindings

In **main.c** there is a variable declared named **light** of type **DeviceTwinBinding**. Variables of type **DeviceTwinBinding** declare a generalized model to define the relationship between an Azure IoT Device Twin and optionally a Peripheral.

The following example associates an Azure IoT Device Twin named **led1**, of type **TYPE_BOOL**, with a GPIO peripheral, that will invoke a handler function named **DeviceTwinHandler**. The implementation of the handler is in **main.c**, and the implementation for TYPE_BOOL will toggle an LED on and off.

```c
static DeviceTwinBinding light = {
	.peripheral = {
		.fd = -1, .pin = LIGHT_PIN, .initialState = GPIO_Value_High, .invertPin = true, .initialise = OpenPeripheral, .name = "led1" },
	.twinProperty = "led1",
	.twinType = TYPE_BOOL,
	.handler = DeviceTwinHandler
};
```

This maps to the **led1** _property_ defined in the Azure IoT Central Device template.

![](resources/iot-central-device-template-interface-led1.png)

---

You can also define a DeviceTwinBinding without a Peripheral. The example below associates an Azure IoT Device Twin with a handler. This handler might do something like change the sampling rate for a sensor or set a threshold on the device.

```c
static DeviceTwinBinding sensorSampleRate = {
	.twinProperty = "sensorsamplerate",
	.twinType = TYPE_INT,
	.handler = SensorSampleRateTwinHandler
};
```

Like Peripherals and Timers, Device Twin Bindings can be automatically opened, initialized, and closed if they are added to the deviceTwinDevices array, also referred to as a **set** of device twin bindings.

```c
DeviceTwinBinding* deviceTwinBindings[] = { &light, &sensorSampleRate };
```

---

## Direct Method Bindings

```c
static DirectMethodBinding feedFish = {
    	.peripheral = { .fd = -1, .pin = FEED_FISH_PIN, .initialState = GPIO_Value_High, .invertPin = true, .initialise = OpenPeripheral, .name = "feedfish" },
	.methodName = "feedfish",
	.handler = FeedFishDirectMethod
};

```

You will find the following example in **main.c**.

```c
static DirectMethodBinding fan = {
	.methodName = "fan1",
	.handler = SetFanSpeedDirectMethod
};
```

This maps to the **fan1** _command_ defined in the Azure IoT Central Device template.

![](resources/iot-central-device-template-interface-fan1.png)

### Setting DirectMethodBindings

Like Peripherals, Timers, Device Twin Peripherals, Direct Method Bindings can be automatically opened, initialized, and closed if they are added to the directMethodDevices array, also referred to as a set of direct method bindings.

```c
DirectMethodBinding* directMethodBinding[] = { &feedFish, &SetFanSpeedDirectMethod };
```

## Open Lab 3

### Step 1: Start Visual Studio 2019

![](resources/visual-studio-open-local-folder.png)

### Step 2: Open the lab project

1. Click **Open a local folder**
2. Open the Azure-Sphere lab folder
3. Open the **folder name** that corresponds to the **Azure Sphere board** you are using
4. Open the **Lab_3_Control_Device_with_Device_Twins_and_Direct_Methods** folder
5. Click **Select Folder** button to open the project

    <!-- ![](resources/visual-studio-open-lab3.png) -->

### Step 3: Configure the Azure IoT Central Connection Information

1. Open the **app_manifest.json** file
2. You will need to redo the settings for the **app_manifest.json** file. Either copy from **Notepad** if you still have open or copy from the **app_manifest.json** file you created in lab 2.

    ![](resources/visual-studio-open-app-manifest.png)

3. Update the contents of this **app_manifest.json**.

## Support for Azure IoT Central Properties

1. Open the **main.c** file
2. Scroll down to the line that reads **static DeviceTwinBinding relay**
    ```c
    static DeviceTwinBinding relay = {
        .peripheral = {
            .fd = -1, .pin = RELAY_PIN, .initialState = GPIO_Value_Low, .invertPin = false, .initialise = OpenPeripheral, .name = "relay1" },
        .twinProperty = "relay1",
        .twinType = TYPE_BOOL,
        .handler = DeviceTwinHandler
    };
    ```
3. This data structure describes the Device Twin. Defined is the Azure IoT Central Device **Property** this peripheral is associated with, the data type, and the **handler**, in this case, named **DeviceTwinHandler**. The handler is the name of the C function that will be called when the device receives a property update from Azure IoT Central.
4. Right mouse click on **DeviceTwinHandler**, and select **Go To Definition**.
    ![](resources/visual-studio-go-to-definition.png)
5. This will jump you to the function named **DeviceTwinHandler**. Review the implementation of the handler.

    ```c
    static void DeviceTwinHandler(DeviceTwinBinding* DeviceTwinBinding) {
        switch (DeviceTwinBinding->twinType)
        {
        case TYPE_BOOL:
            if (*(bool*)DeviceTwinBinding->twinState) {
                GPIO_ON(DeviceTwinBinding->peripheral);
            }
            else {
                GPIO_OFF(DeviceTwinBinding->peripheral);
            }
            break;
        case TYPE_INT:
            Log_Debug("\nInteger Value '%d'\n", *(int*)DeviceTwinBinding->twinState);
            // Your implementation goes here - for example change the sensor measure rate
            break;
        case TYPE_FLOAT:
            Log_Debug("\nFloat Value '%f'\n", *(float*)DeviceTwinBinding->twinState);
            // Your implementation goes here - for example set a threshold
            break;
        case TYPE_STRING:
            Log_Debug("\nString Value '%s'\n", (char*)DeviceTwinBinding->twinState);
            // Your implementation goes here - for example update display
            break;
        default:
            break;
        }
    }
    ```

### Support for Azure IoT Central Commands

1. Again, in the **main.c** file
2. Scroll down to the line that reads **static DirectMethodBinding fan**
3. This data structure describes a generalized peripheral and what Azure IoT Central Device **Command** this peripheral is associated with.  Azure IoT Central device commands are implemented as Azure IoT Direct Methods.

    ```c
    static DirectMethodBinding fan = {
        .methodName = "fan1",
        .handler = SetFanSpeedDirectMethod
    };
    ```

4. Again, right mouse click the **SetFanSpeedDirectMethod** handler, and select **Go To Definition**, and review the handler implementation.

    ```c
    static MethodResponseCode SetFanSpeedDirectMethod(JSON_Object* json, DirectMethodBinding* directMethodBinding) {
        // Sample implementation - doesn't do anything other than returning a response message and status

        // Allocate and initialize a response message buffer. The calling function is responsible for the freeing memory
        const size_t responseLen = 40;
        directMethodBinding->responseMessage = (char*)malloc(responseLen);
        memset(directMethodBinding->responseMessage, 0, responseLen);

        int speed = (int)json_object_get_number(json, "speed");

        if (speed >= 0 && speed <= 100) {
            snprintf(directMethodBinding->responseMessage, responseLen, "%s succeeded, speed set to %d", directMethodBinding->methodName, speed);
            Log_Debug("\nDirect Method Response '%s'\n", directMethodBinding->responseMessage);
            return METHOD_SUCCEEDED;
        }
        else
        {
            snprintf(directMethodBinding->responseMessage, responseLen, "%s FAILED, speed out of range %d", directMethodBinding->methodName, speed);
            Log_Debug("\nDirect Method Response '%s'\n", directMethodBinding->responseMessage);
            return METHOD_FAILED;
        }
    }
    ```

### Support for IoT Central Properties and Commands

1. Again, in **main.c**.
2. Scroll up to the line that reads **#pragma region define sets for auto initialization and close**
3. In this region, there are several arrays that point to the **DeviceTwinBindings** and **DirectMethodBinding** defined above.
    ```c
    DeviceTwinBinding* deviceTwinBindings[] = { &relay, &light };
    DirectMethodBinding* directMethodBindings[] = { &fan };
    ```
4. In the main.c **InitPeripheralsAndHandlers** function these sets of device twins and direct methods are opened and initialized.
    ```c
    static int InitPeripheralsAndHandlers(void)
    {
        InitializeDevKit();  // Avnet Starter Kit

        OpenPeripheralSet(peripherals, NELEMS(peripherals));
        OpenDeviceTwinSet(deviceTwinBindings, NELEMS(deviceTwinBindings));
        OpenDirectMethodSet(directMethodBindings, NELEMS(directMethodBindings));

        StartTimerSet(timers, NELEMS(timers));

        StartCloudToDevice();

        return 0;
    }
    ```

### Expected Behaviour

The expected behaviour will differ depending on what Azure Sphere device you have.

* **Azure Sphere MT3620 Starter Kit**: See that an **Orange** LED lights up on the Azure Sphere.
* **Seeed Studio Azure Sphere MT3620 Development Kit**: See that a **Red** LED lights up on the Azure Sphere.
* **Seeed Studio Azure Sphere MT3620 Mini Dev Board**: See that a **Green** LED lights up on the Azure Sphere.

## Test Azure IoT Central Commands

1. With the application still is running on the Azure Sphere, select the Azure IoT Central **Commands** tab.
2. Set the fan speed to 30 and click **Run**.
    ![](resources/iot-central-device-command-run.png)
3. Click the **View History** button
    ![](resources/iot-central-device-command-view-history.png)
4. The command histor will be similar to the following:
    ![](resources/iot-central-device-commands-view-history.png)
5. Try testing with numbers great that 100, and review the command history.
6. From Visual Studio, try setting a breakpoint in the **SetFanSpeedDirectMethod** handler and then from Azure IoT Central rerun the command. You should see that the Visual Studio debugger has halted the code execution in the handler.
