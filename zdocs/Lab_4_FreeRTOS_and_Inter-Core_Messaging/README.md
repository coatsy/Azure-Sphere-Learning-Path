## What you will learn

You will learn how to deploy a [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/) application to an Azure Sphere Cortex M4 Real-Time core.

You can run Bare Metal applications or applications built on Real-Time frameworks such as FreeRTOS and Azure RTOS on the Azure Sphere Real-Time cores.

The main reason you would run an application on a Real-Time core is when you need precise or highly deterministic timing. For example, you have a sensor driver that requires precise timing.

For security, applications running on Real-Time cores do not have direct internet access. They communicate with the internet via a High-Level application.

 In this lab, you will also learn about **Inter-Core** messaging.

---

## Prerequisites

None.

---

## Tutorial Overview

1. Enable Real-Time core development
2. Deploy your first FreeRTOS Application to Azure Sphere.

---

## Key Concepts

In this lab, you will learn how to secure, deploy, and debug a **Real-Time** FreeRTOS application running on one of the Azure Sphere **Cortex M4** Real-Time cores.

As a reminder, the Azure Sphere has three application cores. The Cortex A7 runs High-Level applications, the two Cortex M4s run Real-Time applications.

Like High-Level applications, Real-Time core applications are locked down by default, so you need to grant permissions to access hardware resources.

For security, applications running on Real-Time cores cannot connect directly to **any** network.

In this lab and the next, you will learn about  **Inter-Core** messaging. Inter-Core messaging provides a secure channel for applications running on different cores to communicate.

### Inter-Core Messaging Security

The FreeRTOS application will send **Button Pressed** events to the **Partner** High-Level application. The High-Level application will then forward the events to Azure IoT Central on behalf of the FreeRTOS application.

Both the FreeRTOS application running on the Real-Time core and the High-Level application need **Inter-Core** messaging permissions. The **app_manifest.json** property **AllowedApplicationConnections** of both applications must include the _Component ID_ of the **Partner** application.

In the following FreeRTOS Real-Time **app_manifest.json** file, the **AllowedApplicationConnections** property is set to the Component ID of the High-Level application.

```json
{
    "SchemaVersion": 1,
    "Name": "GPIO_RTApp_MT3620_BareMetal",
    "ComponentId": "6583cf17-d321-4d72-8283-0b7c5b56442b",
    "EntryPoint": "/bin/app",
    "CmdArgs": [],
    "Capabilities": {
        "Gpio": [ "$AVNET_AESMS_PIN13_GPIO10", "$AVNET_AESMS_PIN14_GPIO12" ],
        "AllowedApplicationConnections": [ "25025d2c-66da-4448-bae1-ac26fcdd3627" ]
    },
    "ApplicationType": "RealTimeCapable"
}
```

In the following High-Level **app_manifest.json** file, the **AllowedApplicationConnections** property is set to the Component ID of the FreeRTOS Real-Time application.

```json
{
  "SchemaVersion": 1,
  "Name": "AzureSphereIoTCentral",
  "ComponentId": "25025d2c-66da-4448-bae1-ac26fcdd3627",
  "EntryPoint": "/bin/app",
  "CmdArgs": [ "Real", "<Relplace with your Scope ID>", "6583cf17-d321-4d72-8283-0b7c5b56442b" ],
  "Capabilities": {
    "Gpio": [ "$AVNET_MT3620_SK_GPIO0", "$AVNET_MT3620_SK_APP_STATUS_LED_YELLOW", "$AVNET_MT3620_SK_WLAN_STATUS_LED_YELLOW" ],
    "Uart": [],
    "I2cMaster": [ "$AVNET_MT3620_SK_ISU2_I2C" ],
    "Adc": [ "$AVNET_MT3620_SK_ADC_CONTROLLER0" ],
    "AllowedConnections": [ "global.azure-devices-provisioning.net", "<Replace with your Azure IoT Central URI>" ],
    "DeviceAuthentication": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "AllowedApplicationConnections": [ "6583cf17-d321-4d72-8283-0b7c5b56442b" ]
  },
  "ApplicationType": "Default"
}
```

## Set up FreeRTOS Real-Time Core Development

### Step 1: Enable Real-Time Core Debugging

Run the **Azure Sphere Developer Command Prompt** as **Administrator**.

1. Press the <kbd>Windows Key</kbd>
2. Start typing **Azure Sphere Developer Command Prompt**
3. Select **Run as administrator**
![](resources/azure-sphere-command-prompt-as-administrator.png)
4. Run

    ```bash
    azsphere device enable-development -r
    ```

5. Exit the command prompt, type **exit**, and press return.

### Step 2: Copy the Floating Point Toolchain

The **AzureSphereRTCoreToolchainVFP.cmake** file is required to build the FreeRTOS application.

Copy the **AzureSphereRTCoreToolchainVFP.cmake** file from **Azure Sphere Learning Path** directory to the system Azure Sphere SDK CMakeFiles directory. The Default destination path is **C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Azure Sphere SDK\CMakeFiles**.

---

## Delete Existing Applications on the Azure Sphere

1. There will be some GPIO pin reassignments between the existing High-Level application that is running on the Azure Sphere and the new Real-Time application that will be deployed to the Azure Sphere in this lab. So delete any existing applications on the Azure Sphere to avoid any clashes.

    From the **Azure Sphere Developer Command Prompt**, run

    ```bash
    azsphere device sideload delete
    ```
2. Restart the Azure Sphere. From the **Azure Sphere Developer Command Prompt**, run

    ```bash
    azsphere device restart
    ```

---

## Open Lab 4

### Step 1: Start Visual Studio 2019

![](resources/visual-studio-open-local-folder.png)

### Step 2: Open the lab project

1. Click **Open a local folder**
2. Open the Azure-Sphere lab folder
3. Open the **folder name** that corresponds to the **Azure Sphere board** you are using
4. Open the **Lab_4_FreeRTOS_and_Inter-Core_Messaging** folder
5. Click **Select Folder** button to open the project

---

## Deploy the FreeRTOS Application to Azure Sphere

1. Set the startup configuration. Select the **ARM-Debug** configuration and the **GDB Debugger (RTCore)** startup item.

    ![](resources/azure-sphere-rtcore-startup-config.png)
3. Press <kbd>**F5**</kbd>, this will start the build, deploy, attach debugger process. The leftmost **blue LED** on the Azure Sphere will start **blinking**.

---

## Expected Behaviour

### Avnet Azure Sphere MT3620 Starter Kit

![](resources/avnet-azure-sphere.jpg)

1. The blue LED will start to blink
2. Press **Button A** on the device to change the blink rate.

### Azure Sphere MT3620 Development Kit

![](resources/seeed-studio-azure-sphere-rdb.jpg)

1. The blue LED will start to blink
2. Press **Button A** on the device to change the blink rate.

### Seeed Studio MT3620 Mini Dev Board

![](resources/seeed-studio-azure-sphere-mini.png)

1. The green LED, the one closest to the USB plug will start to blink.
2. The Seeed Studio Azure Sphere Mini developer kit does not have a built-in button, so every 10 seconds the blink rate will change automatically.

---

## Debugging Real-Time Core Applications

You can Debug the FreeRTOS application running on Azure Sphere Cortex M4 Real-Time Core.

1. From Visual Studio, open the FreeRTOS application **main.c** file.
2. Scroll down to the C function named **LedTask**.
3. Set a [Visual Studio Breakpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/using-breakpoints?view=vs-2019) in the **LedTask** function on the line that reads **rt = xSemaphoreTake(LEDSemphr, portMAX_DELAY);**

    ![](resources/visual-studio-debug-led-task.png)
4. The code will stop executing at the breakpoint
    ![](resources/visual-studio-debug-led-task-stop.png)
5.  You can now start stepping through the code by pressing <kbd>**F10**</kbd> to step over, <kbd>**F11**</kbd> to step into, or <kbd>**F5**</kbd> to continue.
6. Explorer debugging, hover the mouse over the variable named **BuiltInLedOn** and you can see its current value.
7. Click on the **red dot** to delete the breakpoint, and press <kbd>**F5**</kbd> to continue execution.

## Finished 完了 fertig finito ख़त्म होना terminado

**Do NOT** close or stop Visual Studio as we need the FreeRTOS application running for the next lab.
