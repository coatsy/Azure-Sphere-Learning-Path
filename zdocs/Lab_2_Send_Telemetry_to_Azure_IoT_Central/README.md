2. Link your Azure IoT Central to your Azure Sphere Tenant
3. Deploy an Azure IoT Central enabled application to Azure Sphere

---

## Key Concepts

### Azure IoT

Your Azure Sphere device can securely connect and communicate with cloud services. Azure Sphere includes built-in library support for both Azure IoT Hub and Azure IoT Central. This lab focuses on Azure IoT Central.

This project leverages the [Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service (PDS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-sphere/app-development/use-azure-iot?WT.mc_id=github-blog-dglover) which is included with Azure IoT Central. The Device Provisioning Service (DPS) enables zero-touch, just-in-time, large scale device provisioning.

### Azure IoT Central

[Azure IoT Central](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/iot-central/?WT.mc_id=github-blog-dglover) provides an easy way to connect, monitor and manage your Internet of Things (IoT) assets at scale.

## Getting Started with Azure IoT Central

We are going to create an Azure IoT Central application from an application template.

---

## Step 1: Create an Azure IoT Central Application

For this lab, we are going to create an Azure IoT Central Application from a predefined template.

Right mouse click [Azure Sphere Learning Path Azure IoT Central Template](https://apps.azureiotcentral.com/build/new/107ea05b-c031-4866-a0f3-60c934551ac7) to open in a new browser tab.

### Configure the Azure IoT Central Template

1. Name your application
2. Select the **Free** pricing plan

![](resources/iot-central-create-from-template.png)

When you have connected your Azure Sphere to Azure IoT Central you will be able to visualize the device telemetry.

![](resources/iot-central-azure-sphere-dashboad.png)

<!-- Follow instructions to **[Create an Azure IoT Central Application](resources/azure-iot-central/azure-iot-central.md)** -->

---

## Link Azure IoT Central with your Azure Sphere Tenant

You must **link** your Azure IoT Central Application with the Azure Sphere Tenant that your Azure Sphere was claimed into.

**Right mouse click, and open in a new tab the [instructions to set up Azure IoT Central to work with Azure Sphere](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/azure-sphere/app-development/setup-iot-central?WT.mc_id=github-blog-dglover#step-2-download-the-tenant-authentication-ca-certificate)**.

---

## Azure IoT Central Connection Information

Your Azure Sphere device needs the following information to connect to Azure IoT Central with the [Azure Device Provisioning Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-dps/?WT.mc_id=github-blog-dglover).

1. Your Azure Sphere **Tenant ID**.

    * From the **Azure Sphere Developer Command Prompt**, run **```azsphere tenant show-selected```**.
    * The output of this command will look similar to the following.
        ```text
        Default Azure Sphere tenant ID is 'yourSphereTenant' (99999999-e021-43ce-9999-fa9999499994).
        ```
    * The **Tenant ID** is the numeric value inside the parentheses.


2. **Copy the Tenant ID to _Notepad_** as you will need it soon.
3. Your **Azure IoT Central Device Provisioning Service** configuration information.

    1. From the **Azure Sphere Developer Command Prompt**, navigate to the folder you cloned the **Azure Sphere** lab into.

    2. Change to the **tools** folder and run **```ShowIoTCentralConfig.exe```**

        When prompted, log in with your **Azure IoT Central credentials**.

        The output from the _ShowIoTCentralConfig_ will be similar to the following.

        ```text
        Are you using a Work/School account to sign in to your IoT Central Application (Y/N) ?

        Getting your IoT Central applications
        You have one IoT Central application 'yourappname-iot-central'.
        Getting the Device Provisioning Service (DPS) information.
        Getting a list of IoT Central devices.

        Find and modify the following lines in your app_manifest.json:
        "CmdArgs": [ "0ne9992KK6D" ],
        "AllowedConnections": [ "global.azure-devices-provisioning.net", "saas-iothub-9999999-f33a-4002-4444-7ca8989898989.azure-devices.net" ],
        "DeviceAuthentication": "--- YOUR AZURE SPHERE TENANT ID--- "
        ```
        
    3. **Copy** the output of this command from the _Azure Sphere Command Prompt_ to **notepad**.

---

## Open Lab 2

### Step 1: Start Visual Studio 2019

![](resources/visual-studio-open-local-folder.png)

### Step 2: Open the lab project

1. Click **Open a local folder**
2. Open the Azure-Sphere lab folder
3. Open the **folder name** that corresponds to the **Azure Sphere board** you are using
4. Open the **Lab_2_Send_Telemetry_to_Azure_IoT_Central** folder
5. Click **Select Folder** button to open the project

### Step 3: Configure the Azure Sphere Application

1. Open the **app_manifest.json** file
    ![](resources/visual-studio-open-app-manifest.png)

        "CmdArgs": [ "Fake", "0ne0099999D" ],
        "Capabilities": {
            "Gpio": [ "$AVNET_MT3620_SK_GPIO0", "$AVNET_MT3620_SK_APP_STATUS_LED_YELLOW", "$AVNET_MT3620_SK_WLAN_STATUS_LED_YELLOW" ],
            "Uart": [],
            "I2cMaster": [ "$AVNET_MT3620_SK_ISU2_I2C" ],
            "Adc": [ "$AVNET_MT3620_SK_ADC_CONTROLLER0" ],
            "AllowedConnections": [ "global.azure-devices-provisioning.net", "saas-iothub-99999999-f33a-9999-a44a-7c99999900b6.azure-devices.net" ],
            "DeviceAuthentication": "9d7e79eb-9999-43ce-9999-fa8888888894"
        },
        "ApplicationType": "Default"
    }
    ```

4. **Important**. Copy the contents of the **app_manifest.json** file to **notepad** as you will need this configuration information for the next labs.

## Build, Deploy and Debug the Azure Sphere Application

Before building the application with Visual Studio ensure ARM-Debug and GDB Debugger (HLCore) options are selected.

![](resources/visual-studio-start-config.png)

### Sending Telemetry to Azure IoT Central

In **main.c**, scroll down to the **MeasureSensorHandler** C Function. In this function there is a call to **SendMsg(msgBuffer);**. This will send the JSON telemetry to Azure IoT Central.

```c
static void MeasureSensorHandler(EventLoopTimer* eventLoopTimer)
{
	if (ConsumeEventLoopTimerEvent(eventLoopTimer) != 0) {
		Terminate();
		return;
	}

	GPIO_ON(builtinLed); // blink send status LED

	if (ReadTelemetry(msgBuffer, JSON_MESSAGE_BYTES) > 0) {
		Log_Debug("%s\n", msgBuffer);
		SendMsg(msgBuffer);
	}

	GPIO_OFF(builtinLed);
}
```

### Start the Azure Sphere Application

To start the build, deploy, debug process, either click the Visual Studio **Start Selected Item** icon or press **<kbd>F5</kbd>**. To Build and deploy without attaching the debugger, simply press **<kbd>Ctrl+F5</kbd>**.

## Migrate your device to an Azure IoT Central Template

1. Open the Azure IoT Central Application you created.
2. For the next steps, you may need to **wait a minute or two** for **Azure IoT Central** to be updated.
3. Open the **Devices** tab. You may need to wait a minute or two, but eventually there will be a new device listed with a numeric name. 
This numeric name is the ID of your Azure Sphere Device. You can check this by running the  ```azsphere device show``` command from the *Azure Sphere Command Prompt*.
4. Select this new device and click **Migrate**
