## Key Concepts

### Azure IoT

Your Azure Sphere device can securely connect and communicate with cloud services. Azure Sphere includes built-in library support for both Azure IoT Hub and Azure IoT Central. This lab focuses on Azure IoT Central.

This project leverages the [Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service (PDS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-sphere/app-development/use-azure-iot?WT.mc_id=github-blog-dglover) which is included with Azure IoT Central. The Device Provisioning Service (DPS) enables zero-touch, just-in-time, large scale device provisioning.

### Azure IoT Central

[Azure IoT Central](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/iot-central/?WT.mc_id=github-blog-dglover) provides an easy way to connect, monitor and manage your Internet of Things (IoT) assets at scale.

## Getting Started with Azure IoT Central

We are going to create an Azure IoT Central application from an application template.

---

## Step 1: Create an Azure IoT Central Application

For this lab, we are going to create an Azure IoT Central Application from a predefined template.

Right mouse click [Azure Sphere Learning Path Azure IoT Central Template](https://apps.azureiotcentral.com/build/new/107ea05b-c031-4866-a0f3-60c934551ac7) to open in a new browser tab.

### Configure the Azure IoT Central Template

1. Name your application
2. Select the **Free** pricing plan

![](resources/iot-central-create-from-template.png)

When you have connected your Azure Sphere to Azure IoT Central you will be able to visualize the device telemetry.

![](resources/iot-central-azure-sphere-dashboad.png)

<!-- Follow instructions to **[Create an Azure IoT Central Application](resources/azure-iot-central/azure-iot-central.md)** -->

---

## Link Azure IoT Central with your Azure Sphere Tenant

You must **link** your Azure IoT Central Application with the Azure Sphere Tenant that your Azure Sphere was claimed into.



1. Right mouse click, and open in a new tab the [instructions to set up Azure IoT Central to work with Azure Sphere](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/azure-sphere/app-development/setup-iot-central?WT.mc_id=github-blog-dglover#step-2-download-the-tenant-authentication-ca-certificate).
2. Complete steps 2 to 5.

---

## Azure IoT Central Connection Information

The Azure Sphere device requires the following information to connect to Azure IoT Central:

1. The **Azure IoT Central Application**:
    * **Scope ID**, and the **Application URI**.
2. The **Azure Sphere Tenant ID**.

### Azure IoT Central Application Information

You are going to run a command that returns information from Azure IoT Central. You will be asked a series of questions.

Before running the command, read the following as it will tell you how to answer the command prompts.

You will be asked the following:

1. **Are you using a legacy (2018) IoT Central application (Y/N)**. Answer **N**.
2. **URL of your Azure IoT Central Application**. From your browser, open your Azure IoT Central Application and copy the **URL** from the web browser address bar.
![](resources/iot-central-application-url.png)
3. **Enter your Azure IoT Central application API Token**.
    * From your Azure IoT Central Application, select the **Administration** Tab, then **API Tokens**, then click **+ Generate token**.
    * Name the token, for example **myapp**.
    * Click **Generate**, and copy the key.
    ![](resources/iot-central-admin-api-tokens-add.png).
4. **Enter the ID Scope from the IoT Central App**
    * From your Azure IoT Central Application, select the **Administration** Tab, then **Device connection**.
    ![](resources/iot-central-admin-device-connection-scope-id.png)

### Run the ShowIoTCentralConfig Utility

Now you know where to find the the information for _ShowIoTCentralConfig_ lets run the command.

1. Start a Windows or Linux **Command Prompt**
2. From the **command prompt**, navigate to the directory you cloned the **Azure Sphere** lab into.
3. Change to the **tools** directory for your platform. On Windows, ```cd tools\win-x64```, on Linux, ```cd tools/linux-x64```.
4. Run the **```ShowIoTCentralConfig.exe```** command. On completion the command will return information similar to the following:
    ```text
    Find and modify the CmdArgs, AllowedConnections and DeviceAuthentication lines in your app_manifest.json so each includes the content from the below:
    "CmdArgs": [ "0ne000BDC00" ],
    "Capabilities": {
        "AllowedConnections": [ "global.azure-devices-provisioning.net", "iotc-99999999bc-9999-4cba-999e-6573fc4cf701.azure-devices.net" ],
        "DeviceAuthentication": "--- YOUR AZURE SPHERE TENANT ID---",
    }

    Obtain your Azure Sphere Tenant ID by opening an Azure Sphere Developer Command Prompt/Terminal and typing the following command:
    'azsphere tenant show-selected'
    ```
   
5. Open **Notepad**
6. Copy **two lines** from the output of _ShowIoTCentralConfig_ to **Notepad**. The following lines are required. Note, your values will be different.
    * ```"CmdArgs": [ "0ne9992KK6D" ]```
    * ```"AllowedConnections": [ "global.azure-devices-provisioning.net", "iotc-99999999bc-9999-4cba-999e-6573fc4cf701.azure-devices.net" ]```

    The **CmdArgs** value is the **ID Scope** of your Azure IoT Central Application. The **Allowed connections** values includes the global URI for the Device Provision Service, followed by the your **Azure IoT Central Application URI**.

### Azure Sphere Tenant ID

1. From the **Azure Sphere Developer Command Prompt**, run **```azsphere tenant show-selected```**.
    * The output of this command will look similar to the following.
        ```text
        Default Azure Sphere tenant ID is 'yourSphereTenant' (99999999-e021-43ce-9999-fa9999499994).
        ```
    * The **Tenant ID** is the numeric value inside the parentheses.
2. **Copy the Tenant ID to _Notepad_** as you will need it soon.

            "DeviceAuthentication": "9d7e79eb-9999-43ce-9999-fa8888888894"
        },
        "ApplicationType": "Default"
    }
    ```

4. **IMPORTANT**. Copy the contents of the **app_manifest.json** file to **notepad** as you will need this configuration information for the next labs.

## Build, Deploy and Debug the Azure Sphere Application

Before building the application with Visual Studio ensure ARM-Debug and GDB Debugger (HLCore) options are selected.

![](resources/visual-studio-start-config.png)

### Sending Telemetry to Azure IoT Central

In **main.c**, scroll down to the **MeasureSensorHandler** C Function. In this function there is a call to **SendMsg(msgBuffer);**. This will send the JSON telemetry to Azure IoT Central.

```c
static void MeasureSensorHandler(EventLoopTimer* eventLoopTimer)
{
	if (ConsumeEventLoopTimerEvent(eventLoopTimer) != 0) {
		Terminate();
		return;
	}

	GPIO_ON(builtinLed); // blink send status LED

	if (ReadTelemetry(msgBuffer, JSON_MESSAGE_BYTES) > 0) {
		Log_Debug("%s\n", msgBuffer);
		SendMsg(msgBuffer);
	}

	GPIO_OFF(builtinLed);
}
```

### Start the Azure Sphere Application

To start the build, deploy, debug process, either click the Visual Studio **Start Selected Item** icon or press **<kbd>F5</kbd>**. To Build and deploy without attaching the debugger, simply press **<kbd>Ctrl+F5</kbd>**.
